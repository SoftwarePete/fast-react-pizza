## Building to Learn

This repo is my spot for getting the hang of GitHub, React, Redux, Tailwind and web app development in general. I'm here armed with nothing but enthusiasm and a bit of confusion.

## Suggestions welcome

Although this project is created while taking a course - once finished, I plan to keep coming back to it and adding new features / refactoring as I get more experience. Feel free to roast me or give your suggestions/ideas.

## A Disclaimer

Apologies in advance for any messiness you encounter here. We all start somewhere, and it will get better.

Thanks for stopping by, and may your code be bug-free and your coffee strong.
Happy coding! ðŸš€
